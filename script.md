# Lacuna Story

> "Hello, Mr. Holmes," said the bearded old man who had just entered The Stranger's Room.
   The older and comparatively less famous Holmes brother looked up in surprise. He was never interrupted at the Diogenes. He had never been surprised by an unwanted visitor in his entire life. Taking a sip of his Earl Grey, Mycroft looked questioningly at the intruder. Seeking an answer to the obvious question, he went ahead and stated it, "Hello. Who might you be?"
  
> 
"Maupertuis," he replied. Responding to Mycroft's continued expression of confusion, Maupertuis went on, "Perhaps you know me better as 'The Baron'."

> The Baron noted with much pleasure how Mycroft grimaced at his name, though he still felt disappointed at not having been recognized immediately. Surely the buffoons at MI6 were not, well, buffoons. Well, he had to make sure. Just in case. "Mr. Holmes. I come in peace. But before you question the purpose of my visit, you must first prove your mettle."

 > Sherlock woke to his phone pinging. He could feel adrenaline pumping through his veins as his hand crept forward to pick up the phone. One message, an unknown number. Was this spam or was this Mycroft keeping his promise? Hopefully the latter. Hopefully this was a clue to one of Moriarty's henchmen. Maybe, just maybe. One could only have so much fun in a mind palace, grinned Sherlock as he opened the message.

> "Big brother really loves playing his games," noted Sherlock with a smile, as he celebrated his small victory. He had never settled in his shady motel, waiting to leave. Home was just a memory now. At least he had work now to take his mind off the pain of faking his own death. The pain of deceiving John. 

> "I really can't think about all that now, can I?" Sherlock said to himself dismissively, as he picked up his bags and left to where Moriarty's last men remained.

> A month had passed now, and Sherlock had been inducted into the ranks of the monks at the temple. Only this final test remained to prove that he had acheived total peace. After this, he would be one of them, and could finally reveal Moriarty's leutinant. Disguised as a monk, she smuggled drugs right under their very noses. Drugs that had once funded Moriarty's plans. Not anymore though. Once Sherlock had cleared this test and earned the brotherhood of the monks, her game was up.

###### Filter puzzle

> The monks would carry out their own justice. Sherlock need no longer worry about Moriarty's plans making any more money from this source. But it felt too simple. Definitely not Moriarty's style. Smuggling drugs and making money seemed too mundane for a man of Moriarty's ambition. Was there another game afoot? Sherlock hoped not. He would just have to look through her sleeping chambers and make sure to crush every plot and subplot Moriarty had laid out before killing himself that fateful day on the rooftop of Bart's. He could almost see that sick man smile that sick smile of his, basking in his victories, bathing in the chaos that he created. 

> Sherlook looked at the scroll in his hand. A scroll disguised to look old, but no technique this primitive could fool him. The scroll was new, and what it contained must be important.

###### Brainfuck

> An address in New Delhi? Things were getting interesting. Maybe a shipment was due here. Maybe a standoff? The possiblilities were endless, and Sherlock was excited.

> Sherlock was here. An old dilapidated house awaited him, and Sherlock had no intention of testing its patience. Looking around the neighbourhood to check for lookouts and praying to God that the door wasn't booby trapped, he entered the place. He searched room after room, but even his trained eyes could not make out any stashes of drugs or weapons or technology that could possibly entertain Moriarty's consciousness. He came back to the living room. Nothing seemed out of place. Almost nothing. He walked up to the cold fireplace and bent down to inspect it. With a proud egotistic smirk, he removed the false wall behind the fireplace to reveal a door, enforced with steel, sleek and modern unlike the rest of the house. And guarding the door, was the most ridiculous lock Sherlock had ever seen.

###### Directionalyst

> With the door now open, Sherlock crawled through to what resembled a dusty store room. Empty weapon crates. So Sherlock's fears were not ill founded. Drugs were not the only thing that were being smuggled. There were weapons. Moriarty had been planning on war in the South Asia. Surely there would be explosives being smuggled here as well. Hopefully they were still here. But no such luck. The only sustenable lead in the room was a map hastily chucked into the dustbin. A small house in a locality for the wealthy had been marked in red. A posh residence, no doubt, but an explosion here would not lead to many casualties. Maybe this was an assassination. Maybe this wasn't even a bombing. Too many possibilities. The only way to follow up was to get there.

> Sherlock disembarked from the cab, and looked around. The rich fed off the poor and lived in style, with the poor serving them in the menial positions they were assigned. All homes showed signs of activity except for the one he was interested in. Examining the gate for booby traps, he stepped inside. Walking straight up to the door of the house, he found it unlocked and walked straight in. There was a bomb on the table, positioned blatantly without any effort at all to hide the contraption. Moriarty's touch was fading away, realized Sherlock with a sigh as he bent down to defuse the bomb.

###### Map Coordinates

> His job here seemed to be done. The bomb was defused. Sherlock looked around the house but could find nothing of any interest whatsoever. He had a million burning questions in his mind but no answers whatsoever. The frustration was almost unbearable. So Sherlock did what he always did when he was frustrated, which was to actually do his job as a consultant detective in whatever part of the world he happened to be in. All he could do now was wait for big brother to send him a lead. And maybe help the Delhi police out with some of their cases.
 
> It had been just a week. But a week could be so long. Sherlock was already bored. He kept checking the dark corners of the Internet, waiting for a message from his brother. Finally, his wait was over. There was a package at the UK embassy from his brother waiting to be collected. A short visit and a flash of his fake passport later, he had the package in his hands. Opening it back at the motel, he found a box sealed with another of his brother's mischievious puzzles. Oh, Mycroft, when will you ever grow up? 

###### Magic square- 
> Dearest baby brother,
> I hope my letter finds you in good health. Surely you must be enjoying your stay in India. Sadly for us, your visit must be cut short. We have urgent business to deal with. We have a chance to put down another of Moriarty's leutinants, Herr Trepoff. Luckily for us, he has just killed his lovely wife, may her soul rest in peace. Considering his influential position in Germany, the lads at MI6 are certain he will get away with it. I have called in several favours to get you into the jury that shall decide Trepoff's fate. It is imperative that you convince the jury of Trepoff's guilt. Pack your things and get to Hamburg immediately, little brother. May luck be with you, because God only knows you shall need it.
> Yours truly,
> Mycroft 

> Sherlock was on the next flight to Hamburg. This was a golden opportunity to get rid of another one of Moriarty's henchmen, and it had presented itself on a silver platter. Prove Trepoff guilty and he would be locked away for life. But that was easier said than done, considering this was one of Moriarty's elite. Sherlock could feel that a real challenge awaited him once he landed in Hamburg.

> Sherlock had figured out how Trepoff planned to evade justice. He was not even trying to hide the evidence, all he was doing was making sure the jury did not consider him guilty. Trepoff's lawyer planned to scare the jury into submission and unless Sherlock was able to get some leverage on the lawyer, Trepoff would surely walk free. Breaking into the lawyer's office was easy, and so was breaking into his laptop. Logging into his email, he looked over the conversation history that the lawyer and his murderous client shared. Strange. Just one single mail with one nonsensical attachment. Sherlock wrinkled his brow in thought.

###### Zip the mystery

> This was all the leverage Sherlock needed. Trepoff's lawyer would no longer pose a threat to the case. This case was closed. Another one's of Moriarty's lackeys had been dealt with. The web that Moriarty had spun in his lifetime was unravelling bit by bit. Sherlock enjoyed a rare moment of satisfaction. He headed back to his hotel, and was surprised to find a letter waiting for him at reception. A letter from Irene. A letter beckoning him to Amsterdam. So to Amsterdam he went.

>  Irene was being her usual cryptic self. Showing him affection but just not enough. Never enough. To earn her love, he had to prove himself to her. Do whatever she asked. And ask she did. 

###### 1-2-3

> Sherlock looked up from the puzzle she had given him, almost like a school child looking up for praise from his schoolmaster. Oh, the magic Irene held over him. "Well done, my lovely Mr. Holmes," she said with that telltale quiver of her lower lip that always drove Sherlock into a frenzy. Suddenly, as if waking from a stupor, Irene's expression changed. All at once, her entire stature became business-like, the lovely affectionate woman she was just a moment ago seemingly an already distant memory. Sherlock breathed a heavy sigh of despair, which turned into the adoring grin of a lover duped by his queen. 

> What followed was a simple business exchange, with Sherlock already having fulfilled his part by solving the puzzle laid before him. Irene somehow knew that he was hunting down Moriarty's last generals, and the reason she wanted him to come to Amsterdam was so that she could tell him about another of Moriarty's henchmen. The Baron.

> Sherlock's jaw almost dropped at the mention of his name. This man was almost as big an enigma as Moriarty himself. The fact that Irene knew about him laid testimony to Irene's resourcefulness. If Sherlock acted quickly, he could bring an end to Moriarty's entire empire with a single blow. The Baron was an old man named Maupertuis and having spent the last fifteen years masquerading as the respectable business head of the Netherland-Sumatra Company, the Baron had made the mistake of keeping the company going after he went on the run. A new branch of the firm had suddenly opened in Romania, so it seemed likely that he was somewhere nearby. He wouldn't be stupid enough to actually base himself near the offices but he must be somewhere in that part of Europe. Irene had an informant in Brussels who could give Sherlock Maupertuis' location.

> Sherlock reached Brussels and without ado, reached the park that had been arranged as the drop point. He sat inconspicuously on the third bench from the right, the bench that they had decided on. He reached under his seat and extracted an envelope with the information he needed. He smiled as he opened it.

####### Poster 

> Sherlock had all that he needed. The Baron would soon come to justice. He was headed to Belgrade International Airport.

> However, at the airport, the customs officials had other plans. This was unacceptable. His passport had worked flawlessly this far. Mycroft had arranged for the passport himself and it had gotten him in and out of more countries than he cared to count. What could possibly have gone wrong tis time?

> Sherlock's thoughts were interrupted by a customs official, "Call for you, Mr. Bronson." So there was no problem with his fake identity. Why then was he in a small cell at the airport? Sherlock picked up the phone and was lewdly surprised to find his brother on the other end. 

> "Mycroft, get me out of here this instant,"said Sherlock into the receiver. 

> "I'm sorry, little brother. Of course you can leave. Just not to Serbia. You can't have Maupertuis."

> Sherlock was stunned. How was Mycroft possibly in cahoots with The Baron? This seemed to make no sense. Mycroft continued, "He helped us eliminate everyone else Moriarty trusted. We must let him be." And just like that, the line was dead. Just like Sherlock's faith in his brother.

> Sherlock entered his small cell a different man from the one who had exit it. He sat there quietly as the official restrained him to his chair. He was in total despair. The official then, to Sherlock's great surprise, brought in a package and placed it quietly within his handcuffed arms' reach. The man then just as silently removed Sherlock's restraints and left the room. Sherlock ripped open the package with trembling fingers, the fingers of a man who no longer has anything to lose.

###### colour match-Sorry for misleading you Sherlock. Maupertuis' plane is in hangar number 3. Hide on board. Sincerely yours, Mycroft.

> Sherlock was stunned at the message he had just received. He rushed out of his cell out into a surprisingly empty corridor. Not a single guard or official was in sight. Retrieving his belongings from the empty guard's desk, he started sprinting. He ran to hangar number 3, which was also very conveniently unguarded, and hid on board the aircraft. And waited. And waited. And fell asleep.

> Sherlock woke up with a jerk. The aircraft was up in the sky, he was sure of it. Cursing himself inwardly, he tried to analyze the situation. Apparently Maupertuis had boarded the plane and they were flying to Siberia. This was the worst possible situation he could be in. Judging by how rich The Baron was, there must be attendants on board. Two attendants maybe. Not more. 

> He exited the luggage cabin with a fire in his eye. This was it. Moriarty's last thread. Break this, and his whole web would be unravelled. He needed to take down everyone on board the aircraft, and even then, the craft would land in Siberia. There was no way to reach the pilot's cabin from the passengers' cabin in this model. The rich do believe in keeping their affairs private, Sherlock noted grimly. He was now in the attendants' room, with both the attendants engrossed in conversation, probably cursing their rich employer from the tone of their voices. Taking them down was easy; none of them was trained in combat. The odds were slightly better now.

> Sherlock walked into the cabin like he owned the place, making The Baron almost spill his drink in surprise. The Baron reached for the drawer in the table next to him, but Sherlock was quicker. Grabbing a hold of The Baron's wrist, Sherlock broke it with a twist of his arm. Looking into the drawer, Sherlock found a Magnum .52. Sherlock looked in horror at the weapon in his hand.

> This was Moriarty's last agent. Surely he deserved this. Surely. The last thread in the intricate web that Moriarty had spun. This man needed to die for the good of the rest of the world. But Sherlock just couldn't bring himself to do it. He couldn't pull the trigger. Maupertuis saw Sherlock hesitating, and tried to capitalize on the situation. The duo struggled for supremacy, and this struggle ended only once Sherlock pulled the trigger.

> This was no time to panic. The plane was going to land in Serbia. He would surely be caught and tortured. He could not escape once he landed. All he could do now was send a message for help to his brother from Maupertuis' computer. And wait. He was surprised by his brother's quick reply.

###### The dancing man gif

> Sherlock couldn't help but laugh. His brother was sending him puzzles even at a time like this. He would find his brother in Serbia now, all he needed to do was get captured. It was all going to be okay.
