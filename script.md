# Lacuna Story

> "Hello, Mr. Holmes," said the bearded old man who had just entered The Stranger's Room.
   The older and comparatively less famous Holmes brother looked up in surprise. He was never interrupted at the Diogenes. He had never been surprised by an unwanted visitor in his entire life. Taking a sip of his Earl Grey, Mycroft looked questioningly at the intruder. Seeking an answer to the obvious question, he went ahead and stated it, "Hello. Who might you be?"
  
> 
"Maupertuis," he replied. Responding to Mycroft's continued expression of confusion, Maupertuis went on, "Perhaps you know me better as 'The Baron'."

> The Baron noted with much pleasure how Mycroft grimaced at his name, though he still felt disappointed at not having been recognized immediately. Surely the buffoons at MI6 were not, well, buffoons. Well, he had to make sure. Just in case. "Mr. Holmes. I come in peace. But before you question the purpose of my visit, you must first prove your mettle."

 > Sherlock woke to his phone pinging. He could feel adrenaline pumping through his veins as his hand crept forward to pick up the phone. One message, an unknown number. Was this spam or was this Mycroft keeping his promise? Hopefully the latter. Hopefully this was a clue to one of Moriarty's henchmen. Maybe, just maybe. One could only have so much fun in a mind palace, grinned Sherlock as he opened the message.

> "Big brother really loves playing his games," noted Sherlock with a smile, as he celebrated his small victory. He had never settled in his shady motel, waiting to leave. Home was just a memory now. At least he had work now to take his mind off the pain of faking his own death. The pain of deceiving John. 

> "I really can't think about all that now, can I?" Sherlock said to himself dismissively, as he picked up his bags and left to where Moriarty's last men remained.

> A month had passed now, and Sherlock had been inducted into the ranks of the monks at the temple. Only this final test remained to prove that he had acheived total peace. After this, he would be one of them, and could finally reveal Moriarty's leutinant. Disguised as a monk, she smuggled drugs right under their very noses. Drugs that had once funded Moriarty's plans. Not anymore though. Once Sherlock had cleared this test and earned the brotherhood of the monks, her game was up.

> The monks would carry out their own justice. Sherlock need no longer worry about Moriarty's plans making any more money from this source. But it felt too simple. Definitely not Moriarty's style. Smuggling drugs and making money seemed too mundane for a man of Moriarty's ambition. Was there another game afoot? Sherlock hoped not. He would just have to look through her sleeping chambers and make sure to crush every plot and subplot Moriarty had laid out before killing himself that fateful day on the rooftop of Bart's. He could almost see that sick man smile that sick smile of his, basking in his victories, bathing in the chaos that he created. 

> Sherlook looked at the scroll in his hand. A scroll disguised to look old, but no technique this primitive could fool him. The scroll was new, and what it contained must be important.

> An address in New Delhi? Things were getting interesting. Maybe a shipment was due here. Maybe a standoff? The possiblilities were endless, and Sherlock was excited.

> Sherlock was here. An old dilapidated house awaited him, and Sherlock had no intention of testing its patience. Looking around the neighbourhood to check for lookouts and praying to God that the door wasn't booby trapped, he entered the place. He searched room after room, but even his trained eyes could not make out any stashes of drugs or weapons or technology that could possibly entertain Moriarty's consciousness. He came back to the living room. Nothing seemed out of place. Almost nothing. He walked up to the cold fireplace and bent down to inspect it. With a proud egotistic smirk, he removed the false wall behind the fireplace to reveal a door, enforced with steel, sleek and modern unlike the rest of the house. And guarding the door, was the most ridiculous lock Sherlock had ever seen.

> With the door now open, Sherlock crawled through to what resembled a dusty store room
